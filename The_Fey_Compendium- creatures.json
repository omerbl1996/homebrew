Not knowing that the stag was in fact a fey lord, Yondalla kindly fed Oberon a carrot from their bountiful garden. The Green Lord was baffled. Never before had he known such a simple kindness. Soon Oberon was visiting the village every day in a different shape, hoping to experience the simple, wholesome kindness of Yondalla again.",

To his surprise, though, the goddess gently turned him down, stating that though she was flattered by his adoration, she could not give him what he needed. Instead, she gave him a seed from her garden and told him to give it to the one he truly loved. Oberon, somewhat embarrassed, went to the palace he had built for his wife Titania and planted the seed at its base. Quickly, that seed grew into a four leafed clover, from which sprang Squelaiche, the first leprechaun, who became Titania's most beloved jester.",
																	"To this day, Oberon still harbors a great fondness for the people of Yondalla, a fondness shared by the leprechauns who were born from his infatuation. They will often live along the borders of halfling villages, where they lend their aid in protecting the villages from harm and spreading Yondalla's blessing of luck to her people."

While some remain within the Feywild, defending its borders and ruling small realms of their own, others take to the planes to bring the battle to the enemy. Demon lords such as Orcus, Yeenoghu, and Zuggtmoy have found their plans confounded by the efforts of a lelfin warrior."

													"Once, Mag Tureah received a distinguished guest in the form of Baba Yaga. While Baba Yaga stayed as his guest, Thrumbolg demanded that she reveal the future to him. At once outraged and delighted by this young upstart's gall, Baba Yaga cursed him with a prophecy, stating that his death would be by the will of his son. Reasoning that if he killed all his sons that he would become immortal, Thrumbolg decreed the deaths of Goibniu the Smith, Conand the Cruel, and Tethra the Mighty.",
													"When word reached Goibniu of the deaths of his two brothers, he realized his peril. With the aid of an unknown patron, Goibniu used his formidable skill in crafting to forge a spear out of his raw fury and will to live. He named this sword Brionac, the Bright One, and with it in hand he went off to confront his father. The battle was long and arduous, and before Giobniu could land the final blow against his father, an assassin struck him down. Before Thrumbolg could claim the spear, though, Brionac was spirited away from Mag Tureah, thus ensuring that his will to slay his father lived on after his death. Now only Brionac can slay Thrumbolg."

In fact, it is believed that styrix do not lay eggs of their own, but rather poach the young of real owls and nurse them on their milk, causing them to grow into styrix themselves. Even odder, though, is the fact that sometimes a styrix may bond with a human infant, nursing it with its milk during the night, nurturing the growth of magic in the child. Children nursed by a styrix always show magical talent, and many are guided by their dark nursemaids into lives of wickedness. As such, hags are particularly fond of these creatures, as they can nurse their daughters in their stead, ensuring strong offspring.",

Only acid or fire is able to overcome this adhesive defense. As a result, young black dragons are among the only creatures in the natural world capable of safely eating these deadly plants. Beyond black dragons, though, the only other creatures with an interest in clubthorns are the druids, wizards, and alchemists who can utilize the magical properties of their berries in a variety of ways."
